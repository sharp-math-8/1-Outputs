# 1-Outputs

In this activity you will be writing your first python script! 

We are going to learn how to print things in the console when our program runs. The console is where the user interacts with our script: where our output is visible and where users will type their inputs in a future activity.

## Your Task
1. Check out the code sample.
2. See if you can imitate it to print an output when your script runs.
3. Print a number of lines and find out how to print:
  *  A blank line
  *  A dividing line
  *  A box


Bonus
Use comments to describe what you're doing. Comment lines start with "#":
`#I am a comment, I won't get run by Python.`
